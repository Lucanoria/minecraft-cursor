- API Changes:
  - Separated the API from the Root Project, API is now its own library.
    - Check the wiki for the updated installation guide.
    - It can still be accessed from the root project like before as it's an api dependency and included.
      - It would better to use `modCompileOnly` for API and `modRuntimeOnly` for the mod itself.
  - Converted `CursorController` to interface. Methods remain unchanged.
  - Added `AbstractHandledScreenCursorHandler` for `HandledScreen` subclasses.
